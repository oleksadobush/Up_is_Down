# Up is Down

![demo](https://github.com/oleksadobush/Up_is_Down/blob/master/files/demo.gif)

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Game Concept
Simple minimalistic 2D runner. 
There are two types of obstacles: ones to jump on and ones to bend down. Small percent of all the obstacles have special power:
- when a player jumps on an obstacle, a passage opens and the player falls deeper in the ground.
- when a player bends down, a spring activates, so that player is thrown up.
__A player needs to go down at all costs, but for that he needs to jump up high a lot.__


### 1.2 Genre
Single-player, sided-view, runner, casual, adventure

### 1.3 Target Audience
6+ easy to understand game, for wasting some time and not thinking much.

### 1.4 Game Flow Summary
Progress by predefined levels. Player runs from the enemies and depending on its speed he escapes or not.

### 1.5 Look and Feel
Black minimalistic look, vector art. All movements are smooth (?).

## 2.Gameplay and Mechanics

### 2.1 Gameplay

#### 2.1.1 Game Progression
World is a cube - the center is the last level. The higher the lever, the deeper it is in the ground and the closest to the center.

#### 2.1.2 Challenge Structure
Difficulty increases with levels - harder to move, enemies are faster.
there will be more…

#### 2.1.3 Objectives
Escape the enemies and reach the center of the world - deep in the ground.

#### 2.1.4 Play Flow
The player starts from the first level - the outer part of the cube-world. He moves deeper with the levels - to reach the deepest center of the world.

### 2.2 Mechanics
#### 2.2.1 Movement
Move right, up or down.

#### 2.2.2 Actions and interactions
There are special places where a player can jump and then immediately fall down deeper into the ground. And vice-versa, he can bend down and be pushed up the ground by a spring.

#### 2.2.3 Combat
May be later implemented.

#### 2.2.6 UI Flow
Mostly that’s just small messages in the corner of the screen. Where it is not possible - as minimalistic and small window as it can be.

### 2.3 Game Options
dunno

### 2.4 Replaying and Saving
The level can be saved at any time. The levels can not be replayed.

### 2.5 Easter Eggs
May be later implemented.

----
## 4. Levels
One level - one “four-sided” path around the cube.
There are connections between all the levels:
if the player jumps too high, he can turn back to the previous level.
the player can find secret passages to reach next level faster than by reaching the main level exit (by moving deeper in the middle)

## 5. Interface
Eh.

## 8. Game Art
Black minimalistic vector art.
